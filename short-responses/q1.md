# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
When API keys are included in frontend code, they can be easily exposed to anyone who inspects the network requests or views the source code. This can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the API. Making an API request from the server avoids the danger of exposing API keys by keeping the keys secure on the server-side. API keys are stored securely on the server and are never exposed to the client-side environment. The client makes a request to the server, and the server then makes the API request using the secure API keys. This ensures that only the server can use the API keys.By controlling all API requests through the server, you can monitor and manage the usage of the API keys, preventing abuse and unexpected charges.
