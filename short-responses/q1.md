# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
When API keys are included in frontend code, they can be easily exposed to anyone who inspects the network requests or views the source code. This can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the API.
